            <p className="course-descr-body">This course revisits the fundamentals of linear algebra with a focus on practical applications and computational methods. Starting with a review of solving linear equations and matrix operations, it progresses to explore LU and LDV factorizations, subspaces, and vector spaces. Key applications include data fitting and least squares, image compression, and statistical data analysis through singular value decomposition (SVD), and the exploration of Markov chains for ranking systems like Google's PageRank. The course integrates computational exercises using Python within Jupyter notebooks, covering packages such as numpy and pandas, to apply linear algebra concepts to real-world problems.</p>
